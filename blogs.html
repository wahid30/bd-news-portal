          what are the differences between var,let and const in javascript?
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong>VAR:</strong>
          Var statement is also used for variable declaration and it is Global
          scoped variable. Variable declared with var is defined throughout the
          program.Var is defined throughout the function but not if its declared
          in a block as it is not block-scoped.Var statement can be reassigned.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>LET:</strong>
          Let statement is block-scoped and not a Global scope local variable
          used for initializing a statement. This statement can be used in
          function as it is function-scoped and one of the main character of let
          statement is that it can be reassigned.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CONST:</strong>
          Const is quite similar to Let with the only difference that once the
          variable has been defined then its value cannot be changed. Like if
          the user tries to change the value of the const variable, then they
          will get an error.

          What are the differences between arrow functions and regular functions
          in JavaScript?
        </h2>
        <p>
          JavaScript's arrow functions might seem the same as regular functions
          on the surface, but they have some very important differences:
          Syntactical differences, this value (execution context), Usage as
          methods, Usage as constructors, arguments binding.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Syntax</strong>
          The first and most obvious difference between arrow functions and
          regular functions is their syntax. Not only do they look different,
          but arrow functions also provide an implicit return shorthand and
          allow parenthesis around a single argument to be omitted.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Execution context</strong>
          Inside a regular function, execution context (i.e. the value of this)
          is dynamic. This means that the value of this depends on how the
          function was invoked (simple invocation, method invocation, indirect
          invocation or constructor invocation). On the other hand, an arrow
          function does not define its own execution context. This results in an
          arrow function's this being resolved lexically (i.e. the scope in
          which the arrow function was defined).Function.prototype.call(),
          Function.prototype.bind() and Function.prototype.apply() do not work
          correctly with arrow functions either. Their purpose is to allow
          methods to execute within different scopes, but the this value of an
          arrow function cannot be changed, as it's resolved lexically.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Methods</strong>Due to arrow functions not defining their own
          execution context, they're not well-suited for usage as methods.
          However, thanks to the Class fields proposal, arrow functions can be
          used as methods inside classes, if your environment supports it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Constructors </strong>Regular functions can be used as
          constructors, using the new keyword. Yet another consequence of the
          lexical resolution of this inside arrow functions is that they cannot
          be used as constructors. Using new with an arrow function results in a
          TypeError.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Arguments</strong>Another difference is the binding of the
          arguments object. Unlike regular functions, arrow functions don't have
          their own arguments object. A modern alternative that circumvents this
          limitation is the usage of rest parameters.

          why use template string in javascript?
        </h2>
        <p>
          <strong
            >Handling strings is one of the most essentials jobs for software
            development. In JavaScript, there is special syntax for it â€”
            template strings (also called template literals).</strong
          >
          There are 3 Uses of Template Strings in JavaScript:Writing Multi-line
          Strings Directly,String Interpolation with Expressions,Using Tagged
          Templates for Complex Scenarios
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Writing Multi-line Strings Directly:</strong>
          The simplest usage of the template literal is to write a multi-line
          string directly.As shown above, we print a two-line string contained
          by two back ticks. As long as the string has a new line, the
          console.log function prints the new line as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. String Interpolation with Expressions:</strong>
          Writing multi-line strings is just the tip of the iceberg. The power
          of the template string literal is shown by its string interpolation
          ability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Using Tagged Templates for Complex Scenarios:</strong>
          The tagged template is a more advanced usage of the template strings.
          The basic structure of it is as follows:
          <strong>tag_name(arrStrings, exp1, exp2, exp3, ...) </strong>
          Basically, defining a tagged template is similar to defining a
          function. But the parameters of it are special: the first parameter is
          an array of strings, and the following ones are all expressions.
